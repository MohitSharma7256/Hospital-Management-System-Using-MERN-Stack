## üöÄ Rate Limiting & Best Practices

### Performance Tips
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Cache department and news data on frontend
- Implement debouncing for search/filter inputs
- Optimize images before upload

### Security Notes
- All admin endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- File uploads are restricted to images only
- Input validation is enforced on all endpoints
- CORS is configured for specific domains only

### File Upload Limits
- **Max file size**: 10MB
- **Allowed formats**: PNG, JPEG, WebP
- **Storage**: Cloudinary with automatic optimization
